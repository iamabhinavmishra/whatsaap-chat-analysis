Why Indian Market fall like this?\\nSwitzerland is considered as one of the best economy of the world and thats all wealthiest people are having account in their bank. In the last 15 years, Switzerland never increased its lending rate. But yesterday post 15 years Switzerland Govt increased its landing rate by 50 basis points. After that, US markets are in strong fear of economic recessions, further Bank Of England increased its lending rate for the 5th time. So, market reacted heavily after this.\\n👉🏾What to do now?\\nYes, we are going through a hard time. No wonder we are heading towards recessions.\\nGlobal market has already seen recession 14 times and if you check the history every time after a recession when market reversed it will made a new high.\\nAs of now, accumulate your Cash, do your other works, read good books. Re-check your portfolio if you are in good quality stocks you should not be worry at all. Stay invested. Sell off your poor quality stocks. Next 6 months are not going to be easy for the market. So, keep your Investment mode on. Only Long Term Investment approach can make you win this market.\\nIf you want to check history just check charts of 2008. 2008 was even worse but later on we are more than 200% up from there. So, this is just a cycle. \\nKeep your long term view of minimum more than 1 year and relax.😊\\n',\n",
